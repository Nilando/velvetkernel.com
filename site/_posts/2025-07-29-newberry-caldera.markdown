After leaving Lassen National Park, we headed to Newberry National Volcanic
Monument in Eastern Oregon to visit my Mom and Stepdad, Britt, who work as 
volunteer park rangers at Newberry in the Summer. This was our second time
visiting Newberry and there still so much new stuff we got to see and still
things that we didn't have time to get to. It's truly a park packed with awesome
geological features to see.

As volunteer park rangers, my Mom and Britt know alot about Newberry and 
they both shared so much knowledge about the park with us. We got to go on a
guided/interpretive hike with Britt that gave a great overview of the geological 
timeline of the volcanic activity in Newberry. Newberry Caldera once had a peak
with a massive chamber of lava underneath it. At some point around 500,000 years
ago some volcanic activity or eruption cause the magma chamber to empty and
collapse. The result left a caldera which then filled with from rain water to 
form two lakes; Lake Paulina and East Lake which exist today. Thats skipping 
over lots of smaller volcanic events which you can see existing evidence of in 
the park. There are cinder cones, pumice fields, and obsidian flows scattered 
throughout the park that have been formed all within the past 500,000 years and 
many being formed much more recently. Newberry is considered to still be active 
and indeed there is ongoing thermal activity that heats hotsprings on the shores 
of both lakes. While we were there we got to hike out to many of these places; 
including Paulina Lake, a multi acre field of pumice rock, a beach of white
pumice stones, and our favorite, the B.O.F. (Big Obsidian Flow).

While on our hikes we also got to see a lot of awesome wildlife in Newberry! 
The park is home to many chipmunks, nighthawks, Clark's nutcrackers, deer and 
more. Suprisingly some animals, including the Pika and tree frogs, have even 
found homes in the rocky and seemingly unhospitable obsidian flows. We really 
wanted to see a Pika (because they look so adorable!) and spent some time 
looking and walking slowly around the BOF, but we couldn't find any. Margo saw a
tree frog that was hiding in the BOF, but by the time I turned to look at it, it
had jumped away into the pile of obsidian rocks.

One fun memory I'd like to share was when we hiked out to a beach on East Lake. 
We stopped at the beach for lunch and a swim after crossing a thin isthmus on a 
"secret menu" trail midway on a ten mile hike around Paulina. The beach was 
pristine! With no easy trail to get to it the only few other people there had
arrived via boat; we shared the whole beach with just one other family. We first
took our hiking boots off and had our lunch of macaroni with chili. Then we
walked out into the lake for a quick swim. As we waded into the lake, bubbles
started to rise from the lake floor with each step. A moment later it started to 
smell like eggs and we both crinkled our noses. We then noticed that the floor 
of the lake was actually quite warm compared to the water. We realized it must 
be sulfur and warm water getting through from some kind of hotspring! As I
walked around a bit more my foot sunk through the sand and a bunch of bubbles
rushed out of the ground with a strong sulfur smell. After that I thought I
would enjoy the lake by just swim and avoid stirring up any more sulfur, but it 
was definitely a surprising experience!

We also still didn't have time for a few cool things that we will have to come
back for. There are several mile long lavatubes (pyroducts) that you
can hike through as well as a hike to the tops of a cinder cone thats covered in
pumice rocks. Who knows, we just might be back in a year or two for a third 
visit.

There's so many cool facts about Newberry I missed, here are some good ones:
- Newberry originally became a National Monument to thwart an attempt to build
a geothermal powerplant right in the center of the caldera.
- Underneath the topsoil, there is a six foot layer of ash in Newberry that came 
from the eruption that formed crater lake ~7,000 years ago.
- There's evidence that Native American's had been living in the caldera up to
10,000 years ago.
- The most recent lava flow happened just ~1,000 years ago, and 
geologists predict Newberry is overdue for another similar volcanic event! Such
an volcanic event poses a high risk to the neighboring cities of La Pine and
Bend.

Heres thanks to my Mom and Britt for their volunteer work sharing and protecting 
the rich and earthy history of Newberry with everyone. It's an amazing place and 
I recommend everyone to visit. And if you do, make sure you give a friendly 
hello to a park ranger, they just might share with you some epic volcano wisdom.

Big BOF on three! 1, 2, 3! BOF!
