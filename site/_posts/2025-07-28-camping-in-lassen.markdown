Last week I went camping for a couple of nights in Lassen National Park with my 
girlfriend, Margo. We had an amazing time and got to hike to the top of a 
mountain, see some sulfur pits, jump in an alpine lake, and witness an absolute 
explosion of summer wild flowers.

Probably our favorite hike was walking along the Kings Creek. It was a relaxing 
and meandering four mile hike through a forest that was experiencing lots of 
regrowth from a recent burn. Since many of the trees had beened burned, lots of 
sunlight was getting through to the forest floor turning what would have been 
mostly pine needles and manzanita carpet into a meadow of yellow, purple, and
white flowers.

The last time I had been to Lassen was in 2013 before the 2021 Dixie fire
which burned a large portion of the park. Whenever I go camping in places that
are recovering from a major fire I get a bit sad thinking the fire will have 
competely destroyed the wildlife and natural beauty of the place. Yet it seems 
that everytime I visit a burned area I am reminded that fire is just a natural 
part of a forest. The rebounding new growth from the after math of the fire 
never ceeses to amaze me.

This was Margo's first time visiting Lassen. She was very excited to go as she 
loves National Parks and has a stamp book meant for holding her collection of 
stamps from all the parks she's been to. When we arrived the first thing we did 
before setting up our campsite at Summit Lake was to get a stamp from the 
visitor's center.

When we got to our campsite we realized we had forgottten our tent poles! The 
bag with all the tent supplies had everything but the poles lying next to it. 
So we reclined the seats in the car and slept in there for the night. The next 
day after doing a big hike we drove into the nearest town, Red Bluff, and 
bought a Coleman tent at a Walmart Supercenter and decided to name our new tent 
Wally Su, which we love.

After our two nights in Lassen our journey continued North (with a stop at thee
amazing Dos Amigos Taqueria in Redding, CA) through Oregon to Newberry National 
Volcanic Monument.
